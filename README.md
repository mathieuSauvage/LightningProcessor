# Lightning Processor

I made this in python as a personnal project to improve my python skills and learn how to use numpy. It could be optimized more and run even faster in python but that type of plugin should be done in C++ to really have an acceptable speed. I will do that later but for now this is a good proof of concept of my lightning processor. Also the integration of numpy in the newer version of Maya (2013+) seem to be overtly complicated, so there is no future for this python plugin.
